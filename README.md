# Brain-Tumor-Detector
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect MRI images of brain tumors. The model differentiates between healthy individuals and patients with brain tumors based on their MRI scans.

## Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Two convolutional layers, each followed by a non-linear activation function (Tanh) and average pooling.
2. **Fully Connected Layers**: Three fully connected layers with Tanh activation functions, with the final output using a sigmoid activation to classify the image as either healthy or tumor.

### Model Layers:
- **Conv2D** (3 → 6 channels, kernel size = 5)
- **Tanh Activation**
- **AvgPool2D** (kernel size = 2, stride = 5)
- **Conv2D** (6 → 16 channels, kernel size = 5)
- **Tanh Activation**
- **AvgPool2D** (kernel size = 2, stride = 5)
- **Fully Connected Layer** (256 → 120)
- **Tanh Activation**
- **Fully Connected Layer** (120 → 84)
- **Tanh Activation**
- **Fully Connected Layer** (84 → 1)
- **Sigmoid Activation**
